#TODO

Things to be done before we graduate:
- Document the code with comments
- Write up a companion LaTeX'd PDF that has the pictures we have been
  relying on for our procedure
- Add proper exceptions for errors
- Comment on `plot2d()` and `plot3d()`
- Type annotations
- A few examples in the README
